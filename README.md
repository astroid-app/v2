# Astroid

## Improved performance and a RestAPI

Astroid - The Bridge you've always wanted.

### Before setting up

This code are ***our*** API and bots that runs on our own servers. If you have problems setting it up or have problems while its running, it is probably a not changed value in the code.

### Setting up

1. Install the `requirements.txt` (Windows: `pip install -r requirements.txt` | Linux: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`)
2. The bot codes need to be changed before you want to use them, **if you set up your own API**. If not, these can be ignored.
3. Rename `src/Bot/.config.py` to `src/Bot/config.py` and enter your bot tokens and other configurations. **If you are running the API on your own, enter a master token to generate new tokens and to give the bots access to the endpoints globally. If you're just using your own bot/s, enter your endpoints token as master token (your Astroid token).**.
4. Run your wanted python files.

### Bugs

If you encounter bugs, errors or other things feel free to contact me or open a issue/pull request.
If you change your code in any way that isn't supposed to change and bugs/errors occour, **dont** contact me to ask why xyz isn't working!
